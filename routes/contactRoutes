//he aboove is the chaining method where the multiple request have same end point that is here /

router.route("/:id").get(getContact).put(updateContacts).delete(deleteContact);//this tells when the url have the id then based on the thing the user want one of the above thing would be issued by the server
//the same the abpve one is the chained routing where the multilple request have same end points
